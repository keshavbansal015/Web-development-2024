    <h2>Basic Structure of an HTML Document</h2>
    <p>An HTML document has a basic structure that includes doctype, html, head, and body tags. But obviously now there are so many more annoying tags.</p>

    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>HTML offers six levels of headings, from h1 to h6. h1 is used for main headings, followed by h2, and so on, to h6. We are not limited to these font sizes, we can adjust them with very fine control now.</p>
    <h1>Heading 1 (h1)</h1>
    <h2>Heading 2 (h2)</h2>
    <h3>Heading 3 (h3)</h3>
    <h4>Heading 4 (h4)</h4>
    <h5>Heading 5 (h5)</h5>
    <h6>Heading 6 (h6)</h6>
